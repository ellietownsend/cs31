/* A person runs on a tredmil for fiftneen minuties a day as part of their exercise routine. They start the workout at a speed of 4MPH for the first three minuites, and then increase it by 2MPH after every four minuites. Write a program to calculate the total calroies burned during this workout. The number of calories burned may be estimated by using the formula:
 
    calories/minuites = 0.0175 * MET * Weight
 
    Running at 6 mph expends 10 METS. Your program should input the person's weight in kilograms and output the calories burned by them.
