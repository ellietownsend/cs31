/* Buoyancy is the ability of an object to float. Archimedesâ€™ Principle states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the fluid that is displaced by the submerged object. The buoyant force can be computed by
          Fb = V * g
    where Fb is the buoyant force, V is the volume of the submerged object, and g is the specific weight of the fluid. If Fb is greater than or equal to the weight of the object, then it will float, otherwise it will sink.
    Write a program that inputs the weight (in pounds) and radius (in feet) of a sphere and outputs whether the sphere will sink or float in water. Use g = 62.4 lb/ft3 as the specific weight of water. The volume of a sphere is computed by (4/3)pr3.*/
