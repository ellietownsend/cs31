void findPrime();
/* Write a program that finds and prints all of the prime numbers between 3 and 100. a prime number is a number that can only be divided by one and itself. One way to solve this problem is to use a doubly nested loop. The outerloop can iteratre from 3-100, while the inner loop checks to see wherther the counter value for the outer loop is prime. One way to decide where the number n is prime is to loop from 2 to (n-1) if any of these numbers evenly divide n, then n must be prime. */
