/*
 Negotiating a consumer loan is not always straightforward. One form of loan is the dicousnt installment loan, which works as follows. Suppose a loan has a face value of 1,000, the interest rate is 1% and the duration is 18 months. The interest is computed by multiplying the face value of 1,000 by 0.15, yielding 150. That figure is then muliplied by the loan period of 1.5 years to yield 225 as the totoal interest owned. That mount if immidnelty deducted from the face value, leaving the consumer with only $775. Repayment is made in equal monhtly installments based on the face value. So the montly loan payment will be 1000 divided by 18, which is 55.56. This method of calauction many not be too bad if the cnsumer needs 775, but the calacualtion is a bit more omplicated i the consumer needs 1,000. Write a program that will take three inputs: The amount the conumer needs to recieve, the interest rate, and the duration of the loan in months. The program should then calacute the face value required in order to for the consumer to recieve the amount needed. It should also calacute the monthly payment.
