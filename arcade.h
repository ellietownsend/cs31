/* The video game machines at your local arcade output coupons depending on how well you play the game. You can redeem 10 coupns for a candy or 3 coupons for a gumball. You prefer candy bars to gumballs. Write a program that inputs the number of coupons you win and outputs how many candy bars and gumballs you can get if you spend all of your coupons on candy bars first and any remaining coupons on gumballs*/
