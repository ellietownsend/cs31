/* In order to manage their funds efficently, a person deposits an amount of money in a bank account. They withdrawl a fixed portion on the fifth day of every month for their household expenses. The bank credits the interest accumulated on their balance on the last day of every month. Write a program that inputs the inital deposit made, the interest rate provided by the bank, and the fixed amount withdrawn every month. Calualte the number of months the amount (including the credited interest) can be utilized. (use a loop)
 Note: Check the boundary conditions - If the interest earned every month is greater than the fixed withdrawl amount, the program should print the message and return
