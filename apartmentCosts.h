/* A real-estate developer wants to estimate the cost of each apartment on each floor of his development before he starts marketing them. He has decided to quote different prices for apartments on different floors. The price for all aparements from the second floor on will see a 2% increase in their base price. For example, if an apartment on the first floor would have a base price of 650,000, and apartment on the second floor would have a base price of 663,000. Charges on amernities are charged at a specified rate on an apartments base price. Taxes are calculated at a specified rate on the sum on the apartments base price and the charge of amenities. Your program asks for the number of stories, the base price of apartments on the first floor, and the rates (as a decimal) of the charges on aminities and taxes. The program should output the base price, charges on amenities, taxes and the total price of apartments on each floor. (Hint: use a for loop)*/
